Experimental repository for a D [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) binding.

Automatically generated from the [Arrow GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib) API for the most part.

A more efficient Parquet read implementation bypassing `GObject` abstractions is provided in [dparquet.d](https://github.com/rostyboost/darrow/blob/master/src/dparquet.d).

Current Arrow version: `0.15.1`
